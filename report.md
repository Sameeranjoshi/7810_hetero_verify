1. Abstract
  This is the last part to be written.
2. Introduction
  1. Talk about What recent trend in architectures.
  2. Talk about why we need unified memory.
  3. Challenges and pros of unified Memory.
  4. What consistency models and why important.
  5. Why testing is important of these Consistency models.
  6. What are we doing and why it matters?
  7. What is the main idea we are exploring.
  8. "This paper presents"/contributions of this paper/work.
3. Motivation
  This point can be combined with intro.
4. Background
  1. Consistency models
  2. Litmus testing
  3. Unified memory
5. Testing strategies used
  * Each strategy with it's own examples and pros and cons.
6. Results
  * Running on different GPU's
  * Characterization
  * AMD gpu? by converting using some CUDA->Rocm tool.
